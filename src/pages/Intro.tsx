            Noli Me Tangere was published in 1887 in Berlin, Germany, during the
            late Spanish colonial era in the Philippines. During this time,
            Philippine society faced widespread corruption, friar exploitation,
            and social injustices caused by Spanish rule. During Rizal's time,
            Spanish colonization had created a society marked by rampant
            corruption and his sole purpose was to awaken national consciousness
            and inspire reform.
